# Friday Night Funkin': Psychic Engine
### funkin'... in HTML5!

Do be aware that I'm not working on this anymore, nor do I intend to return to it. This was a very dark and brooding period of my life... where I had no idea what I was doing. Please, for your sake and mine, don't look through this repository. It may scar you... **forever...**

#### Some stuff you might wanna know

This only works on devices with a external keyboard, such as a desktop/laptop computer, or a Chromebook. However you may be able to workshop a way to play on mobile too with some weird third-party app idk
